## How to install

To install the project, we recommend to use `pipx` to install the project in a virtual environment.

```bash
pipx install  {{ vars.project }}
```

This is the recommended way to install the project, but you can also install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install {{ vars.project }}
```
