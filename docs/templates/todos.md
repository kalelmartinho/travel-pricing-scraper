## TODO

Improvements that can be made to the project.

- [ ] Add a `--headless` flag to the CLI.
    - So that the user can choose whether to run the browser in headless mode or not.
- [ ] Add a way to consult codes for airports
    - Currently, the user needs to know the airport codes to use the CLI. It would be interesting to add a way to consult the codes for airports.
- [ ] Add scraping for other agencies
    - Currently, the project only scrapes data from decolar.com. It would be interesting to add other agencies to the project.
